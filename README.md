incomplete space theme two-player shooter
- well idea comes from combining that hockey mobile game and a space shooter
  
# Future implementation idea list 
- side by side shoot each other
- may have power-ups
- pause
- main menu / start button ,etc
- add music
- add sprites and background
- score scenario
- MODE-1 -> limited number of lives ✔
- MODE-2 -> a goal to achieve to win && infinite life
- MODE-3 -> limited time, highest score win
  
- Peace out✌😎
